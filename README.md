Babel           - transpile ES6 to ES5 for browser compatibility
                - some features can't transpile, so babel-polyfill will be used.
babel-polyfill  - large +50k..so pick only wht needed
webpack         - compiles javascript into one file
mocha           - testing  
ESLint          - alert issues with javascript
